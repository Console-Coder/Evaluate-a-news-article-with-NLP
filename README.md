# About this project

This project is mainly a training project to improve my understanding of Webpack build system.

In this project I will mainly:
- Setup a Webpack environment (specially dev server)
- I will use Sass styles for better syntax and faster to write code.
- I will use many Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- I will improve offline experince using Service workers
- I will be using APIs and creating requests to external urls so I can give the user the required emotional analysis.
